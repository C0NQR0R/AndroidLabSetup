# Android Lab Build

This repository provides a step-by-step guide for building your own **Android Pentesting Lab** using **Nox Emulator**, **ADB**, **Burp Suite**, **Frida**, and **Objection**.  
It is based on practical challenges and solutions during setup.

---

## Challenges
1. Choosing a good emulator and Android version.  
2. Connecting **adb (Windows)** with the emulator.  
3. Connecting **adb (Kali VM)** with the emulator.  
4. Connecting **Burp Suite (Windows)** with the emulator.  
5. Installing **Objection** (Windows), **Frida (Windows)** and its server on the emulator.  
6. Fixing network proxy bug.  

---

## Solutions & Steps

### 1. Choosing Emulator & Android Version
- Problem: Not all emulators/versions work well with pentesting tools.

- âœ… Solution: Use **Nox Emulator** with **Android 12** using Nox Asst.

### 2. Connect ADB (Windows) with Emulator
- Problem: you can't find the Nox emulator
<img width="1263" height="441" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54a9f0f6-9bf2-4b62-9bc1-4c860f12b29e" />

- âœ… Solution:
  use the following commands to discover Nox ports
<img width="786" height="29" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bdaf4df-87be-4f1a-80dd-283c877532c4" />
<img width="951" height="185" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97fcddb9-e992-4705-bf4b-4b58b8e009a7" />
<img width="947" height="52" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a391e4f-93b4-420a-8dcf-28ef2abc0ab5" />

- Try them all, till you catch port for your emulator
<img width="812" height="246" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae3611db-74fe-491f-9b5f-08be14a6593c" />

In this case to connect to the Emulator you can 
1. Disconnect from other devices then make adb connect 
```
adb disconnect 127.0.0.1:57001
adb disconnect 127.0.0.1:64001
adb disconnect emulator-5554
```

2. Or directly specify the emulator:  
```
adb -s 127.0.0.1:62026 shell
```

### 3. Connect ADB (Kali) with Emulator

Keep your VM network setting to NAT, and check if you can ping you windows from Kali VM
<img width="817" height="234" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c28f96f-1020-4f00-8206-39585562dd26" />

By default, Nox/Android Emulator listens only on 127.0.0.1:62026 (local only). We need to forward it to 0.0.0.0 so Kali can connect.
By default, Windows Firewall blocks incoming TCP connections from other devices on the network unless thereâ€™s an explicit allow rule.

<img width="1598" height="377" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02006844-3a82-4567-9851-6eafe722b858" />

Now connect from the kali `adb connect <win-ip>:<nox-port>` 
<img width="852" height="434" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f035f4c-ad7a-461f-ab34-ea909b31d694" />


### 4. Connect Burp (Windows) with Emulator

1. Open Burp and get your Windows IP using:
```
ipconfig
```

<img width="958" height="390" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a42e8ff-abf0-4938-9b20-6050b1f5029a" />
<img width="1192" height="789" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a925f0ff-e007-4e7e-abb0-dc530c0428a4" />

2. Connect emulator with adb.
3. Reverse port so Burp catches traffic:

<img width="1003" height="121" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7b47e8d-e276-4a7f-b83e-dd880d687b90" />

Now any connection to 127.0.0.1:8888 inside the emulator is tunneled to the same port on your Windows host, so burp will catch it


  
### 5. Frida & Objection Setup

Reinstall python and check add PATH to environment variable
Then use Frida version to use is 16.5.9 with Itâ€™s server 
<img width="409" height="37" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa416a84-de54-440d-81b8-caf67ea844dd" />
<img width="620" height="169" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/498058f2-c606-47bc-a05f-742b3a60ea9a" />

Frida server download:
ðŸ‘‰ (Frida 16.5.9 Release)[https://github.com/frida/frida/releases/tag/16.5.9] 

Then use Objection 1.11.0
<img width="553" height="60" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a657e2e-d47e-47df-828c-e85d38f56ff1" />

- IMPORTANT NOTE:
Installing Objection sometimes updates Frida Version, So make sure after installing it, to downgrade Frida Version

Install like this :
```
pip install frida-tools
pip install objection==1.11.0
pip install frida==16.5.9
```

### 6. Fix Proxy Bug

<img width="623" height="875" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b662039d-a6f3-415d-bbfd-166ba34a5382" />

Workaround: Drag the network proxy slider to the left inside settings ðŸ˜…
- There is a bug on the Nox network proxy , To edit the Proxy -> hold and drag to left xD



- Tested on: Windows 11 + Kali Linux + Nox Android 12.
